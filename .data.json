        "name":"Apache Path Traversal Vulnerability",
        "description":"In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49, attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration require-all-denied, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.",

        "description":"The name Spring4Shell was picked because Spring Core is a ubiquitous library, similar to log4j which spawned the infamous Log4Shell vulnerability. A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, there may be other ways to exploit it. The vulnerable application can be accesed at /spring-form/greeting on the web server.",
